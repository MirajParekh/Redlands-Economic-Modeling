# Redlands_Data_Modeling
Final project for CSC-235
Final Project Proposal
feedback:

This is good, but a little short on detail.  Where will you get the Redlands population data?  What drives population change other than growth rate?  Economic success(job rates), mental health (could add suicide rates and education rates), significant weather changes or temp changes that impact migration. Housing prices. 

What will a 3/3 look like? - datausa redlands ca. Graphs should look similar. Able to model various rates, then use them to produce data that can be used to predict various successes for Redlands and other communities in the future very roughly. There will be a lot of analysis
Extra possibly: predicting significant weather events or temperature increases or decreases, that can bridge to climate zone changes, can also model farms and corporate farms locally if impacting (or other impactors) and even corporate vs local make up.
 A 2/3? -
A 1/3? - 
* Do you have benchmarks/milestones for the next 2 weeks?

I want to focus on expanding topics from our population growth exercises and Project 2. While Project 2 focused on hypothetical situations, I want this Final to represent likely outcomes. I want to gather and display population data from my hometown of Redlands CA and use that to determine the future economic outlook for the city and see what the city is currently doing to expand its growth. Furthermore, I want to create a more accurate “projected population” graph for Redlands than what we covered during our practice exercises and Project 2 by adding in new variables such as number of people moving in per year, number of deaths (average), number of births, etc. With this, I can likely also display data on how many of the total residents are natively born there, or traveled to Redlands from somewhere else. I plan on getting initial data from the US Census website. My end goal however is to predict the future of the city in terms of population, demographics, and economic outlook. I chose this idea because Redlands is my home and I want to research and learn more about the city I grew up in and will soon return to.
